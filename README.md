# task-3-555-oscillator-

 Design a 555 astable multivibrator with a duty cycle 60%, rig up the circuit on a breadboard, and by using the probes observe the output of your circuit on the DSO. Basic Astable 555 Oscillator: The 555 IC can function as an astable oscillator to generate continuous square wave pulses.
 It operates by continuously re-triggering itself, allowing it to function as a free-running oscillator.

circuit configuration: Connect pins 2 (trigger) and 6 (threshold) together to enable re-triggering for astable operation.
The timing resistor from the monostable circuit is split into two resistors, R1 and R2.

Waveform Generation: During each cycle, the capacitor charges through both R1 and R2 but discharges only through R2. 
Output waveform voltage level is approximately Vccâˆ’1.5V.

Charge and Discharge Times: Charge time (t1) and discharge time (t2) determine the frequency of oscillations.
T=t1+t2, where T is the total periodic time.

Output Frequency Equation: f=1/T=1/(t1+t2).

Duty Cycle Adjustment: The duty cycle can be adjusted by changing the ratio of resistors R2 to R1. The duty cycle is the ratio of the "ON" time to the "OFF" time.
